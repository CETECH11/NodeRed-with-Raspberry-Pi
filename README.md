Node-RED is a powerful open-source visual programming tool for building Internet of Things (IoT) applications. In this tutorial, weâ€™ll cover what Node-RED is, how to install it, and how to use the visual interface to create a simple flow.

Node-RED is an effective open-source platform for developing Internet of Things (IoT) applications that aim to make the programming part simpler.
Node-RED is a web-based application that employs visual programming to let you link code fragments, or "nodes," together to carry out a task. When the nodes are connected, they form flows.

--> IBM created open-source Node-RED software.
--> The Raspberry Pi flawlessly runs Node-RED.
--> Because it is a visual programming tool, a wider spectrum of users can use it.
--> Node-RED allows you to spend less time writing code and more time creating exciting things.

Node-RED forms it easy to:
--> access the GPIOs on your RPi;
--> connect to other devices via MQTT;
--> For your projects, develop a responsive graphical user interface;
--> Interact with outside services.
--> Get information from the internet, such as stock prices, emails, and weather forecasts;
--> Organize time-based events;
--> Keeping and getting information from a database.
--> Now that we are aware of Node-Red, okay. We need a physical medium to install Node-Red, and the Raspberry Pi will serve that purpose.

In this Project, we are going to Integrate Raspberry Pi with Node Red and create a simple flow to control some LEDs over Internet. The GPIO Pins on the Raspberry Pi will be used to control the LEDs and The control signals will be sent to the Raspberry Pi over Internet using Node Red. This Logic can be used in several different real life scenarios to create useful Home Automation tools.
